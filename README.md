## 1.0  Theory





## 2.0   Usage
The code is written by the C++, before download the code you need:
'''
1. Prepare a compilable c++ environment. With download the GNU complier, like gcc, g++ etl;
2. Download and install the Eigen library;
3. Install Cmake and compile the source files according to CmakeLists in the Citrine5 folder.
'''
Running the Citrine5.exe and view the calculations result in the csv folder. The output.csv is the result file.

Then viewing the graphical results with using the code in Matlab folder, the PostProcess folder includes the Force and Profile result.

Note: 
1. Change the file "setting.json" to specify the path to the compiler.
2. Specify the CMake source path and the CMake executable path.


## 3.0 Showcase:
We did a set of related pendant calculations based on the above theory and code, and the specific distribution state and mechanical properties of the flexible body are shown below:
